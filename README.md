This repo creates an API to better understand and visualize the inner workings 
of a CNN with GradCam; currently MobileNet powered by TensorFlow and Google 
Cloud Functions. This also shows using the Postman Visualizer to make sense of 
the API responses and visualize the journey of an image in the model.

## Run Locally

To get up and running with this API, run the following commands, make sure you 
have Python installed. This runs the function in built-in local development 
server:

```
git clone https://github.com/Rishit-dagli/Visualize.AI # or clone your own fork
cd Visualize.AI
pip install -r requirements.txt
functions-framework-python --target conv_vis
# Can also use --debug
```

Your function should now be running on localhost:8080 üöÄ.

## About the APIüìù

This API was deployed on GCP Cloud Functions and is extremely easy to deploy 
your own such API. You can simply deploy it to your own Cloud Function with 
this command:

```sh
gcloud functions deploy conv_vis --runtime python38 --memory 8196MB --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated
```

Or even do this with the Google Cloud GUI.

### Using the API

#### Endpoint URL

```
https://us-central1-sound-fastness-257416.cloudfunctions.net
```

#### Request Params

| Key         | Description                                                                     |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| image       | URL of the image you put in the model                                           |
| destination | File name of the destination image, remember to use extension (.png , .jpg etc) |


#### Just want to test out?

I got you covered, I have added an example image as the default value for you to try out here are the default values:

| Key         | Default Value                   |
|-------------|---------------------------------|
